/**
 This is the base class for other file output stream classes to extend.

 ### Buffered I/O with File Output Streams

 Something important to consider is I/O buffering.
 The file output stream will output to a file descriptor but for system performance an I/O write
 doesn't happen synchronously, it gets buffered until one of the following is encountered:

    1. enough output is buffered
    2. the file descriptor is closed
    3. the file descriptor is explicitly flushed

 For debugging, you can use the exposed property on the file output stream to explicitly flush on
 every write, but it is recommended to only do so when trying to debug something specific and never
 be enabled in production builds.   See `flushAfterEveryWriteEnabled`

 To offer increased control over output streams buffering, `TLSLoggingService` exposes a `flush`
 method.  It is recommended that you `flush` whenever you encounter an explicit need to have the
 buffered I/O be output to disk, such as:

    1. When the app backgrounds
    2. When the app is terminated
    3. When a crash is detected (call it JIT flushing)
    4. When the logs need to be read (like when you zip them up for a bug report)
