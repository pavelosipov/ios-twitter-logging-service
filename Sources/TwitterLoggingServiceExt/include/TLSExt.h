 `os_log` or you will hit an infinite loop!  Take care you do not log these messages to
 `TLSOSLogOutputStream`.  `TLSNSLogOutputStream` will be fine since `NSLog` messages are filtered
 out by the __TLSExt__ system that captures `os_log` messages.

/**
 # __Twitter Logging Service Extensions__ (aka __TLSExt__)

 __TLSExt__ provides extra functionality outside of __TLS__ itself and can be compiled and linked by
 any app consuming __TLS__.

 The features of __TLSExt__ are tied to Private frameworks from Apple and are therefore deemed
 _unsafe_ for shipping with production code.

 @warning Only compile / link __TLSExt__ into non-production builds!  Compiling/linking __TLSExt__ into production builds __will__ result in app store rejection!

 @note __TLSExt__ depends on __TLS__, but it would be fairly simple to change the `TLSLogMessageInfo` uses into something that doesn't depend on __TLS__ if you want to capture `os_log` activity without depending on __TLS__.

 ## TLSExt Errors

     FOUNDATION_EXTERN NSString * const TLSExtErrorDomain;

 ## os_log activity monitoring

 __TLSExt__ provides APIs to observe `os_log` activity.  This is a great feature when capturing logs
 to debug issues that might only be seen in the logs from Apple frameworks, or if `os_log` ends up
 being a logging mechanism for an app.

 At Twitter, we elect to capture the `os_log` activity and write it to disk in a rolling log.  When
 an employee encounters an issue and they file a bug report from our dogfood app, these logs (among
 others) are zipped up and sent to our bug reporting system.  We do not link __TLSExt__ at all in
 production -- it is strictly a tool for non-production builds.

 ### Set the start time for activity monitoring

 Call `TLSExtSetOSLogActivityStartTimestamp` with and `NSDate` timestamp to set the starting time
 when `os_log` activity started (can be rough estimate). Leaving unset will use the first encountered `os_log` entry's timestamp (until this function is called).

    FOUNDATION_EXTERN void TLSExtSetOSLogActivityStartTimestamp(NSDate *timestamp);

 ### Create an os_log activity monitor instance

 Use `TLSExtOLSLogActivityMonitorCreate` convenience function to create a `TLSExtOSLogActivityMonitor`
 instance.  See `TLSExtOSLogActivityMonitor`.

     FOUNDATION_EXTERN id \<TLSExtOSLogActivityMonitor\> TLSExtOLSLogActivityMonitorCreate(
                                                                NSString * __nullable defaultChannel,
                                                                TLSExtOSLogActivityLogMessageBlock __nullable logMessageBlock,
                                                                TLSExtOSLogActivityLogMessageBlock __nullable activityStreamEventBlock
                                                                            ) NS_RETURNS_RETAINED;

 Or instantiate a custom implementation of `TLSExtOSLogActivityMonitor` protocol

 ### Registering an os_log activity monitor

 Register a `TLSExtOSLogActivityMonitor` for monitoring `os_log` messages with `TLSExtRegisterOSLogActivityMonitor`

    FOUNDATION_EXTERN BOOL TLSExtRegisterOSLogActivityMonitor(id \<TLSExtOSLogActivityMonitor\> monitor,
                                                              NSError * __nullable * __nullable outError);

 Returns `YES` if the _monitor_ could register successfully.  `NO` if registration failed.

 ### CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS monitoring

 With __TLSExt__ support of `os_log` monitoring, it is now possible to easily capture `CFNetwork`
 logs to help debug while developing.  What used to require a special profile installed on a specific
 device followed by a sysdiagnose (takes 10 minutes to gather!), now can just be captured in whatever
 logs you prefer.

 To enable `CFNetwork` logs, you must set the `"CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS"` environment variable to a
 desired logging level (`"1"`, `"2"` or `"3"`), and it must be done _before_ any `NSURLSession`
 instances are instantiated.

    setenv("CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS", "1", 1);

 3 ways to do it:

   1. Set the environment variable before running the given app (edit target app's scheme: under Run > Arguments > Environment Variables).
   2. Set the environment variable early during execution, such as during the `main` function starting.
   3. Set the environment variable with a C constructor (so it runs before `main`).
